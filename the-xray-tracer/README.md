# The X-Ray Tracer

This is a pattern not defined by the components used but how they send information back to the AWS X-Ray service to help you make your application perform better when viewed through the Serverless [Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) lens.

## Well Architected Framework

The [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of
decisions you make while building systems on AWS. By using the Framework, you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.

We believe that having well-architected systems greatly increases the likelihood of business success.

### The Operational Excellence Pillar

<strong>Note -</strong> The content for this section is a subset of the [Serverless Lens Whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Serverless-Applications-Lens.pdf) with some minor tweaks.

The [operational excellence pillar](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Serverless-Applications-Lens.pdf#page=28) includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

#### Distributed Tracing
Similar to non-serverless applications, anomalies can occur at larger scale in distributed systems. Due to the nature of serverless architectures, itâ€™s fundamental to have distributed tracing.

Making changes to your serverless application entails many of the same principles of deployment, change, and release management used in traditional workloads. However, there are subtle changes in how you use existing tools to accomplish these principles.

<strong>Active tracing with AWS X-Ray should be enabled to provide distributed tracing capabilities as well as to enable visual service maps for faster troubleshooting</strong>. 

X-Ray helps you identify performance degradation and quickly understand anomalies, including latency distributions.

Service Maps are helpful to understand integration points that need attention and resiliency practices. For integration calls, retries, backoffs, and possibly circuit breakers are necessary to prevent faults from propagating to downstream services. 

Another example is networking anomalies. You should not rely on default timeouts and retry settings. Instead, tune them to fail fast if a socket read/write timeout happens where the default can be seconds if not minutes in certain clients.

X-Ray also provides two powerful features that can improve the efficiency on identifying anomalies within applications: Annotations and Subsegments.
Subsegments are helpful to understand how application logic is constructed and what external dependencies it has to talk to. Annotations are key-value pairs with string, number, or Boolean values that are automatically indexed by AWS X-Ray.

Combined, they can help you quickly identify performance statistics on specific
operations and business transactions, for example, how long it takes to query a
database, or how long it takes to process pictures with large crowds.
