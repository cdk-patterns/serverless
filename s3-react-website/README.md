# AWS S3 / React Website Pattern
This is a starter with AWS CDK and React packaged together in a way that you can deploy the starter React application to s3 with no changes

### Possible Architecture:
![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdk-patterns/serverless/master/s3-react-website/img/architecture.PNG)

### Packaged Architecture:
This pattern out of the box deploys the React website to Amazon S3 but does not setup CloudFront, Route53 or Aws Certificate Manager. You can learn how to do that by looking at the [cdk-spa-deploy docs](https://github.com/nideveloper/CDK-SPA-Deploy)
