# Polly Pattern

![overview image](img/overview.png)

This is a pattern that integrates the Amazon Polly service into an AWS Lambda Function so that you can synthesize text into speech using a serverless stack. It also integrates with Amazon Translate to allow you to choose the language for the spoken text.

## What is Included In This Pattern?

After deployment you will have an API Gateway HTTP API configured where all traffic points to a Lambda Function that calls the Polly / Translate service.

### API Gateway HTTP API
This is setup with basic settings where all traffic is routed to our Lambda Function

### Lambda Function
Takes in whatever voice you want and whatever text you want, translates it to whatever language you want then sends it to the Polly service and returns an Audio stream

## Testing The Pattern

After deployment in the deploy logs you will see the url for the API Gateway.

If you open that URL in chrome it will play an audio recording saying &quot;To hear your own script, you need to include text in the message body of your restful request to the API Gateway&quot;

You can customise this message based on how you call the url:

### Changing the voice
You can pick from 3 voices "Matthew" (the default), "Joanna" or "Lupe". This is using the newsreader style of voice which AWS recently launched so it currently only supports these 3.

To change voices just add a query param onto your url like:

```
https://{api-url}/?voice=Lupe
https://{api-url}/?voice=Joanna
https://{api-url}/?voice=Matthew
```

### Changing the language spoken
This Lambda Function is integrated with Amazon Translate so you can have Polly speak a variety of languages

To have Lupe speak spanish just add the translateTo query param

```
https://{api-url}/?voice=Lupe&translateTo=es
```

If your text you are translating is in a language other than english you can use the translateFrom parameter

To understand what languages are possible please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html)

### Changing the text
If you use a tool like Postman to send text in the body of a POST request to the url it will use Polly to synthesize your text

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `npm run deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
