# The Scalable Webhook

This is an example CDK stack to deploy The Scalable Webhook stack described by Jeremy Daly here - https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/#scalablewebhook

You would use this pattern when you have a non serverless resource like an RDS DB in direct contact with a serverless resource like a lambda. You need to make
sure that your serverless resource doesn&apos;t scale up to an amount that it DOS attacks your non serverless resource.

This is done by putting a queue between them and having a lambda with a throttled concurrency policy pull items off the queue and communicate with your 
serverless resource at a rate it can handle.
