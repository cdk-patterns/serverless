# The Simple Webservice

This is an example CDK stack to deploy The Simple Webservice stack described by Jeremy Daly here - https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/#simplewebservice

An advanced version of this pattern was talked about by [Heitor Lessa](https://twitter.com/heitor_lessa) at re:Invent 2019 as The comfortable “REST”

Most of this code was borrowed from https://cdkworkshop.com/.

This is the most basic of implementations and would have to be hardened before production use. e.g. cognito added to the API Gateway

![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdk-patterns/serverless/master/the-simple-webservice/img/architecture.png)

After deployment you should have a proxy api gateway where any url hits a lambda which inserts a record of the url into a dynamodb with a count of how many times that url has been visited.
