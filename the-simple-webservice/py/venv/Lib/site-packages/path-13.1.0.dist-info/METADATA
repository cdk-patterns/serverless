``path`` (aka path pie, formerly ``path.py``) implements path
objects as first-class entities, allowing common operations on
files to be invoked on those path objects directly. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from path import Path
    d = Path('/home/guido/bin')
    for f in d.files('*.py'):
        f.chmod(0o755)

    # Globbing
    for f in d.files('*.py'):
        f.chmod('u+rwx')

    # Changing the working directory:
    with Path("somewhere"):
        # cwd in now `somewhere`
        ...

    # Concatenate paths with /
    foo_txt = Path("bar") / "foo.txt"

Path pie is `hosted at Github <https://github.com/jaraco/path>`_.

Guides and Testimonials
=======================

Yasoob wrote the Python 101 `Writing a Cleanup Script
<http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/python-101-writing-a-cleanup-script/>`_
based on ``path``.

Advantages
==========

Python 3.4 introduced
`pathlib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`_,
which shares many characteristics with ``path``. In particular,
it provides an object encapsulation for representing filesystem paths.
One may have imagined ``pathlib`` would supersede ``path``.

But the implementation and the usage quickly diverge, and ``path``
has several advantages over ``pathlib``:

- ``path`` implements ``Path`` objects as a subclass of
  ``str``, and as a result these ``Path``
  objects may be passed directly to other APIs that expect simple
  text representations of paths, whereas with ``pathlib``, one
  must first cast values to strings before passing them to
  APIs unaware of ``pathlib``. This shortcoming was `addressed
  by PEP 519 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0519/>`_,
  in Python 3.6.
- ``path`` goes beyond exposing basic functionality of a path
  and exposes commonly-used behaviors on a path, providing
  methods like ``rmtree`` (from shlib) and ``remove_p`` (remove
  a file if it exists).
- As a PyPI-hosted package, ``path`` is free to iterate
  faster than a stdlib package. Contributions are welcome
  and encouraged.
- ``path`` provides a uniform abstraction over its Path object,
  freeing the implementer to subclass it readily. One cannot
  subclass a ``pathlib.Path`` to add functionality, but must
  subclass ``Path``, ``PosixPath``, and ``WindowsPath``, even
  if one only wishes to add a ``__dict__`` to the subclass
  instances.  ``path`` instead allows the ``Path.module``
  object to be overridden by subclasses, defaulting to the
  ``os.path``. Even advanced uses of ``path.Path`` that
  subclass the model do not need to be concerned with
  OS-specific nuances.

Alternatives
============

In addition to
`pathlib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`_, the
`pylib project <https://pypi.org/project/py/>`_ implements a
`LocalPath <https://github.com/pytest-dev/py/blob/72601dc8bbb5e11298bf9775bb23b0a395deb09b/py/_path/local.py#L106>`_
class, which shares some behaviors and interfaces with ``path``.

Development
===========

To install a development version, use the Github links to clone or
download a snapshot of the latest code. Alternatively, if you have git
installed, you may be able to use ``pip`` to install directly from
the repository::

    pip install git+https://github.com/jaraco/path.git

Testing
=======

Tests are invoked with `tox <https://pypi.org/project/tox>`_. After
having installed tox, simply invoke ``tox`` in a checkout of the repo
to invoke the tests.

Tests are also run in continuous integration. See the badges above
for links to the CI runs.

Releasing
=========

Tagged releases are automatically published to PyPI by Travis-CI, assuming
the tests pass.

Security Contact
================

To report a security vulnerability, please use the
`Tidelift security contact <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.
Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.
