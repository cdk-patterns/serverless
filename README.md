This is intended to be a repo containing all of the official AWS Serverless architecture patterns built with CDK for developers to use.

Follow [@CdkPatterns](https://twitter.com/cdkpatterns) for live discussion / new pattern announcements. I plan to add a new pattern weekly so check back regularly!

You can also check out our [Deconstructing CDKPatterns](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuR3jnWEnxx1G2axUMVaogg) YouTube channel for in depth walk throughs of the patterns.

Note, this is maintained by [@nideveloper](https://twitter.com/nideveloper) not AWS. For my motivation, please read this [blog post](https://www.mattcoulter.com/blog/post/2)

## New to AWS CDK?

* To learn more visit the [AWS getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
* To do a workshop on CDK visit [cdkworkshop.com](https://cdkworkshop.com)
* Visit the [Hey CDK &quot;How To&quot; series](https://garbe.io/blog/2019/09/11/hey-cdk-how-to-migrate/) for some detailed answers
* Check out [Awesome CDK](https://github.com/eladb/awesome-cdk) for a curated list of awesome projects related to CDK

## Pattern Usage
All patterns are available in Typescript and Python so pick your favourite language! Note the Typescript patterns all include unit tests but right now I have not seen a standard python testing approach

You can always clone this repo which contains every pattern in python/typescript but if you just want a single pattern in one language follow these steps:

### 1) Choose your pattern
Browse the "Grouped Alphabetically" patterns list below or run:

```bash
npx cdkp list
```

### 2) Download Pattern In Python or Typescript CDK
>Something to be aware of is that the Python version may reuse the JS lambdas from the TypeScript version. This is to reduce the amount of development effort when creating these patterns. It means at launch the TypeScript and Python patterns are effectively identical when deployed but you get the choice of Python or TypeScript for the CDK implementation.
>
>I will look to refactor the Python patterns slowly to full Python after initial launch. If you want to help with this effort, pull requests are always welcome!
<details>
  <summary>TypeScript</summary>
  <br />
  All Patterns support the same commands so you can just run:
  <br />
  
 ```bash
npx cdkp init {pattern-name}
cd {pattern-name}
npm run test
# requires you to be using cloud9 or have ran aws configure to setup your local credentials
npm run deploy 
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Python</summary>
  <br />
  The CDK CLI is still installed via npm so make sure you have the latest version of node installed or the npx commands will fail. Then you can just run:
  <br />
  
  ```bash
npx cdkp init {pattern-name} --lang=python
cd {pattern-name}

# create a virtual env and install your dependencies
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# test everything is working by outputting the cloudformation
npx cdk synth
# requires you to be using cloud9 or have ran aws configure to setup your local credentials
npx cdk deploy
```
</details>

## Patterns

[The Filter Pattern By Component Used Page](https://www.serverless-patterns.co.uk/patterns/) allows you to filter patterns by a serverless component e.g. Lambda or API Gateway HTTP API visit, otherwise:

<details>
  <summary>
    Grouped Alphabetically
  </summary>

  #### [Polly](/polly/README.md)
  Use Amazon Polly to translate text to speech from inside a Lambda Function. You can also take advantage of Amazon Translate to change the language of the spoken text

  ![Architecture](polly/img/overview.png)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### Single Page Application S3 Website Deploy
  These are built using https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk-spa-deploy and allow you to deploy a website in as little as 5 lines of CDK code.

  * [S3 Angular Deploy ](/s3-angular-website/README.md)
  * [S3 React Deploy ](/s3-react-website/README.md)

  ![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdk-patterns/serverless/master/s3-angular-website/img/architecture.PNG)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The Basic MQ](/the-basic-mq/README.md)  
  In this example we have private Amazon MQ brokers behind an internet-facing network load balancer endpoint using a subdomain.

  ![Architecture](the-basic-mq/img/the-basic-mq-arch.png)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The Big Fan](/the-big-fan/README.md)  
  You can integrate API Gateway directly with SNS and then add some resiliency by integrating your event consumers via sqs and message filtering.

  ![Architecture](the-big-fan/img/the-big-fan-arch.png)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The CloudWatch Dashboard](/the-cloudwatch-dashboard/README.md)  
  Build and deploy a well architected CloudWatch dashboard with alerts for the simple webservice pattern

  ![Architecture](the-cloudwatch-dashboard/img/arch2.png)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The Destined Lambda](/the-destined-lambda/README.md)
  This is a stock implementation of Lambda Destinations with Amazon EventBridge
  
  You can decouple your event driven architectures with EventBridge rules and now you can strip the custom EventBridge code from your Lambda functions with Lambda Destinations.

  ![Architecture](the-destined-lambda/img/arch.png)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The Dynamo Streamer](/the-dynamo-streamer/README.md)

  You can integrate API Gateway directly with DynamoDB and that way your systems can be more resilient! &quot;Code is a liability&quot; so less lambda functions, less liability

  ![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdk-patterns/serverless/master/the-dynamo-streamer/img/arch.jpg)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The EFS Lambda](/the-efs-lambda/README.md)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The EventBridge ATM](/the-eventbridge-atm/README.md)
  This was taken from this [Blogpost](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/integrating-amazon-eventbridge-into-your-serverless-applications/)<br />

  You can easily create routing rules in EventBridge to send the same event to multiple sources based on conditions. This example shows you how<br /><br />

  ![Architecture](the-eventbridge-atm/img/amazon-eventbridge-custom-application-2.png)

  <br /><hr /><br />

## Serverless Well Architected Pattern Matcher

The [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of
decisions you make while building systems on AWS. By using the Framework, you will
learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient,
and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently
measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.
We believe that having well-architected systems greatly increases the likelihood of
business success.
