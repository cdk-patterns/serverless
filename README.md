This is intended to be a repo containing all of the official AWS Serverless architecture patterns built with CDK for developers to use.

Follow [@CdkPatterns](https://twitter.com/cdkpatterns) for live discussion / new pattern announcements. I plan to add a new pattern weekly so check back regularly!

Note, this is maintained by [@nideveloper](https://twitter.com/nideveloper) not AWS. For my motivation, please read this [blog post](https://www.mattcoulter.com/blog/post/2)

## New to AWS CDK?

* To learn more visit the [AWS getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
* To do a workshop on CDK visit [cdkworkshop.com](https://cdkworkshop.com)
* Visit the [Hey CDK &quot;How To&quot; series](https://garbe.io/blog/2019/09/11/hey-cdk-how-to-migrate/) for some detailed answers
* Check out [Awesome CDK](https://github.com/eladb/awesome-cdk) for a curated list of awesome projects related to CDK

## Pattern Usage
All patterns are available in Typescript and Python so pick your favourite language! Note the Typescript patterns all include unit tests but right now I have not seen a standard python testing approach

<details>
  <summary>TypeScript</summary>
  <br />
  All Patterns (unless otherwise stated in their readme) should support the same commands so you can just run:
  <br /><br />
  
  * `git clone https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless.git`
  * `cd {pattern-name}/typescript`
  * `npm i` - install the dependencies
  * `npm run build` - build the project
  * `npm run test` - run the unit tests
  * `npm run deploy` - deploy the pattern into your AWS account&#42;
  <br />
  
  &#42; Note this requires you to be using cloud9 or have ran aws configure to setup your local credentials
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Python</summary>
  <br />
  The CDK CLI is still installed via npm so make sure you have the latest version of node installed or the npx commands will fail. Then you can just run:
  <br /><br />
  
  * `git clone https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless.git`
  * `cd {pattern-name}/python`
  * `python -m venv .env` - Create a virtual env
  * `source .env/bin/activate` - Activate the virtual env
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install the dependencies
  * `npx cdk synth` - generate a cft from the stack to validate your setup
  * `npx cdk deploy` - deploy the pattern into your AWS account&#42;
  <br />
  
  &#42; Note this requires you to be using cloud9 or have ran aws configure to setup your local credentials

  You can integrate API Gateway directly with DynamoDB and that way your systems can be more resilient! &quot;Code is a liability&quot; so less lambda functions, less liability

  You can easily create routing rules in EventBridge to send the same event to multiple sources based on conditions. This example shows you how<br /><br />
