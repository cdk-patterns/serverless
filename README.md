This is intended to be a repo containing all of the official AWS Serverless architecture patterns built with CDK for developers to use.

Follow [@CdkPatterns](https://twitter.com/cdkpatterns) for live discussion / new pattern announcements. I plan to add a new pattern weekly so check back regularly!

Note, this is maintained by [@nideveloper](https://twitter.com/nideveloper) not AWS. For my motivation, please read this [blog post](https://www.mattcoulter.com/blog/post/2)

## New to AWS CDK?

* To learn more visit the [AWS getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
* To do a workshop on CDK visit [cdkworkshop.com](https://cdkworkshop.com)
* Visit the [Hey CDK &quot;How To&quot; series](https://garbe.io/blog/2019/09/11/hey-cdk-how-to-migrate/) for some detailed answers
* Check out [Awesome CDK](https://github.com/eladb/awesome-cdk) for a curated list of awesome projects related to CDK

## Pattern Usage
All patterns are available in Typescript and Python so pick your favourite language! Note the Typescript patterns all include unit tests but right now I have not seen a standard python testing approach

You can always clone this repo which contains every pattern in python/typescript but if you just want a single pattern in one language follow these steps:

### 1) Choose your pattern
Browse the "Grouped Alphabetically" patterns list below or run:

```bash
npx cdkp list
```

### 2) Download Pattern In Python or Typescript CDK
<details>
  <summary>TypeScript</summary>
  <br />
  All Patterns support the same commands so you can just run:
  <br />
  
 ```bash
npx cdkp init {pattern-name}
cd {pattern-name}
npm run test
# requires you to be using cloud9 or have ran aws configure to setup your local credentials
npm run deploy 
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Python</summary>
  <br />
  The CDK CLI is still installed via npm so make sure you have the latest version of node installed or the npx commands will fail. Then you can just run:
  <br />
  
  ```bash
npx cdkp init {pattern-name} --lang=python
cd {pattern-name}

# create a virtual env and install your dependencies
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# test everything is working by outputting the cloudformation
npx cdk synth
# requires you to be using cloud9 or have ran aws configure to setup your local credentials
npx cdk deploy
```
</details>

  #### Single Page Application S3 Website Deploy
  These are built using https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk-spa-deploy and allow you to deploy a website in as little as 5 lines of CDK code.

  * [S3 Angular Deploy ](/s3-angular-website/README.md)
  * [S3 React Deploy ](/s3-react-website/README.md)

  <br /><hr /><br />

  #### [The Big Fan](/the-big-fan/README.md)  
  You can integrate API Gateway directly with SNS and then add some resiliency by integrating your event consumers via sqs and message filtering.

  #### [The Dynamo Streamer](/the-dynamo-streamer/README.md)
  This was taken from this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/edjgeek/status/1220227872511496192?s=20)<br />
  
  You can integrate API Gateway directly with DynamoDB and that way your systems can be more resilient! &quot;Code is a liability&quot; so less lambda functions, less liability

  #### [The EventBridge ATM](/the-eventbridge-atm/README.md)
  This was taken from this [Blogpost](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/integrating-amazon-eventbridge-into-your-serverless-applications/)<br />

  You can easily create routing rules in EventBridge to send the same event to multiple sources based on conditions. This example shows you how<br /><br />
