# AWS S3 / Angular Website Pattern
This is a starter with AWS CDK and Angular packaged together in a way that you can deploy the starter angular cli application to s3 with no changes

### Possible Architecture:

### Packaged Architecture:
This pattern out of the box deploys the Angular website to Amazon S3 but does not setup CloudFront, Route53 or Aws Certificate Manager. You can learn how to do that by looking at the [cdk-spa-deploy docs](https://github.com/nideveloper/CDK-SPA-Deploy)
