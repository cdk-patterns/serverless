This is achieved by creating an instance of\n`Vpc`:\n\n```ts\nconst vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'VPC');\n```\n\nAll default constructs require EC2 instances to be launched inside a VPC, so\nyou should generally start by defining a VPC whenever you need to launch\ninstances for your project.\n\n### Subnet Types\n\nA VPC consists of one or more subnets that instances can be placed into. CDK\ndistinguishes three different subnet types:\n\n* **Public** - public subnets connect directly to the Internet using an\n  Internet Gateway. If you want your instances to have a public IP address\n  and be directly reachable from the Internet, you must place them in a\n  public subnet.\n* **Private** - instances in private subnets are not directly routable from the\n  Internet, and connect out to the Internet via a NAT gateway. By default, a\n  NAT gateway is created in every public subnet for maximum availability. Be\n  aware that you will be charged for NAT gateways.\n* **Isolated** - isolated subnets do not route from or to the Internet, and\n  as such do not require NAT gateways. They can only connect to or be\n  connected to from other instances in the same VPC. A default VPC configuration\n  will not include isolated subnets,\n\nA default VPC configuration will create public and private subnets, but not\nisolated subnets. See *Advanced Subnet Configuration* below for information\non how to change the default subnet configuration.\n\nConstructs using the VPC will \"launch instances\" (or more accurately, create\nElastic Network Interfaces) into one or more of the subnets. They all accept\na property called `subnetSelection` (sometimes called `vpcSubnets`) to allow\nyou to select in what subnet to place the ENIs, usually defaulting to\n*private* subnets if the property is omitted.\n\nIf you would like to save on the cost of NAT gateways, you can use\n*isolated* subnets instead of *private* subnets (as described in Advanced\n*Subnet Configuration*). If you need private instances to have\ninternet connectivity, another option is to reduce the number of NAT gateways\ncreated by setting the `natGateways` property to a lower value (the default\nis one NAT gateway per availability zone). Be aware that this may have\navailability implications for your application.\n\n\n[Read more about\nsubnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html).\n\n### Control over availability zones\n\nBy default, a VPC will spread over at most 3 Availability Zones available to\nit. To change the number of Availability Zones that the VPC will spread over,\nspecify the `maxAzs` property when defining it.\n\nThe number of Availability Zones that are available depends on the *region*\nand *account* of the Stack containing the VPC. If the [region and account are\nspecified](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html) on\nthe Stack, the CLI will [look up the existing Availability\nZones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#using-regions-availability-zones-describe)\nand get an accurate count. If region and account are not specified, the stack\ncould be deployed anywhere and it will have to make a safe choice, limiting\nitself to 2 Availability Zones.\n\nTherefore, to get the VPC to spread over 3 or more availability zones, you\nmust specify the environment where the stack will be deployed.\n\n### Using NAT instances\n\nBy default, the `Vpc` construct will create NAT *gateways* for you, which\nare managed by AWS. If you would prefer to use your own managed NAT\n*instances* instead, specify a different value for the `natGatewayProvider`\nproperty, as follows:\n\n```ts lit=test/integ.nat-instances.lit.ts\n    // Configure the `natGatewayProvider` when defining a Vpc\n    const natGatewayProvider = ec2.NatProvider.instance({\n      instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.small')\n    });\n\n    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {\n      natGatewayProvider,\n\n      // The 'natGateways' parameter now controls the number of NAT instances\n      natGateways: 2,\n    });\n```\n\nThe construct will automatically search for the most recent NAT gateway AMI.\nIf you prefer to use a custom AMI, pass a `GenericLinuxImage` instance\nfor the instance's `machineImage` parameter and configure the right AMI ID\nfor the regions you want to deploy to.\n\n### Advanced Subnet Configuration\n\nIf the default VPC configuration (public and private subnets spanning the\nsize of the VPC) don't suffice for you, you can configure what subnets to\ncreate by specifying the `subnetConfiguration` property. It allows you\nto configure the number and size of all subnets. Specifying an advanced\nsubnet configuration could look like this:\n\n```ts\nconst vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'TheVPC', {\n  // 'cidr' configures the IP range and size of the entire VPC.\n  // The IP space will be divided over the configured subnets.\n  cidr: '10.0.0.0/21',\n\n  // 'maxAzs' configures the maximum number of availability zones to use\n  maxAzs: 3,\n\n  // 'subnetConfiguration' specifies the \"subnet groups\" to create.\n  // Every subnet group will have a subnet for each AZ, so this\n  // configuration will create `3 groups × 3 AZs = 9` subnets.\n  subnetConfiguration: [\n    {\n      // 'subnetType' controls Internet access, as described above.\n      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,\n\n      // 'name' is used to name this particular subnet group. You will have to\n      // use the name for subnet selection if you have more than one subnet\n      // group of the same type.\n      name: 'Ingress',\n\n      // 'cidrMask' specifies the IP addresses in the range of of individual\n      // subnets in the group. Each of the subnets in this group will contain\n      // `2^(32 address bits - 24 subnet bits) - 2 reserved addresses = 254`\n      // usable IP addresses.\n      //\n      // If 'cidrMask' is left out the available address space is evenly\n      // divided across the remaining subnet groups.\n      cidrMask: 24,\n    },\n    {\n      cidrMask: 24,\n      name: 'Application',\n      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE,\n    },\n    {\n      cidrMask: 28,\n      name: 'Database',\n      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.ISOLATED,\n\n      // 'reserved' can be used to reserve IP address space. No resources will\n      // be created for this subnet, but the IP range will be kept available for\n      // future creation of this subnet, or even for future subdivision.\n      reserved: true\n    }\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nThe example above is one possible configuration, but the user can use the\nconstructs above to implement many other network configurations.\n\nThe `Vpc` from the above configuration in a Region with three\navailability zones will be the following:\n\nSubnet Name       |Type      |IP Block      |AZ|Features\n------------------|----------|--------------|--|--------\nIngressSubnet1    |`PUBLIC`  |`10.0.0.0/24` |#1|NAT Gateway\nIngressSubnet2    |`PUBLIC`  |`10.0.1.0/24` |#2|NAT Gateway\nIngressSubnet3    |`PUBLIC`  |`10.0.2.0/24` |#3|NAT Gateway\nApplicationSubnet1|`PRIVATE` |`10.0.3.0/24` |#1|Route to NAT in IngressSubnet1\nApplicationSubnet2|`PRIVATE` |`10.0.4.0/24` |#2|Route to NAT in IngressSubnet2\nApplicationSubnet3|`PRIVATE` |`10.0.5.0/24` |#3|Route to NAT in IngressSubnet3\nDatabaseSubnet1   |`ISOLATED`|`10.0.6.0/28` |#1|Only routes within the VPC\nDatabaseSubnet2   |`ISOLATED`|`10.0.6.16/28`|#2|Only routes within the VPC\nDatabaseSubnet3   |`ISOLATED`|`10.0.6.32/28`|#3|Only routes within the VPC\n\n### Reserving subnet IP space\n\nThere are situations where the IP space for a subnet or number of subnets\nwill need to be reserved. This is useful in situations where subnets would\nneed to be added after the vpc is originally deployed, without causing IP\nrenumbering for existing subnets. The IP space for a subnet may be reserved\nby setting the `reserved` subnetConfiguration property to true, as shown\nbelow:\n\n```ts\nconst vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'TheVPC', {\n  natGateways: 1,\n  subnetConfiguration: [\n    {\n      cidrMask: 26,\n      name: 'Public',\n      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,\n    },\n    {\n      cidrMask: 26,\n      name: 'Application1',\n      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE,\n    },\n    {\n      cidrMask: 26,\n      name: 'Application2',\n      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE,\n      reserved: true,   // <---- This subnet group is reserved\n    },\n    {\n      cidrMask: 27,\n      name: 'Database',\n      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.ISOLATED,\n    }\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nIn the example above, the subnet for Application2 is not actually provisioned\nbut its IP space is still reserved. If in the future this subnet needs to be\nprovisioned, then the `reserved: true` property should be removed. Reserving\nparts of the IP space prevents the other subnets from getting renumbered.\n\n### Sharing VPCs between stacks\n\nIf you are creating multiple `Stack`s inside the same CDK application, you\ncan reuse a VPC defined in one Stack in another by simply passing the VPC\ninstance around:\n\n```ts lit=test/integ.share-vpcs.lit.ts\n/**\n * Stack1 creates the VPC\n */\nclass Stack1 extends cdk.Stack {\n  public readonly vpc: ec2.Vpc;\n\n  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    this.vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'VPC');\n  }\n}\n\ninterface Stack2Props extends cdk.StackProps {\n  vpc: ec2.IVpc;\n}\n\n/**\n * Stack2 consumes the VPC\n */\nclass Stack2 extends cdk.Stack {\n  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props: Stack2Props) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    // Pass the VPC to a construct that needs it\n    new ConstructThatTakesAVpc(this, 'Construct', {\n      vpc: props.vpc\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nconst stack1 = new Stack1(app, 'Stack1');\nconst stack2 = new Stack2(app, 'Stack2', {\n  vpc: stack1.vpc,\n});\n```\n\n### Importing an existing VPC\n\nIf your VPC is created outside your CDK app, you can use `Vpc.fromLookup()`.\nThe CDK CLI will search for the specified VPC in the the stack's region and\naccount, and import the subnet configuration. Looking up can be done by VPC\nID, but more flexibly by searching for a specific tag on the VPC.\n\nSubnet types will be determined from the `aws-cdk:subnet-type` tag on the\nsubnet if it exists, or the presence of a route to an Internet Gateway\notherwise. Subnet names will be determined from the `aws-cdk:subnet-name` tag\non the subnet if it exists, or will mirror the subnet type otherwise (i.e.\na public subnet will have the name `\"Public\"`).\n\nHere's how `Vpc.fromLookup()` can be used:\n\n```ts lit=test/integ.import-default-vpc.lit.ts\nconst vpc = ec2.Vpc.fromLookup(stack, 'VPC', {\n  // This imports the default VPC but you can also\n  // specify a 'vpcName' or 'tags'.\n  isDefault: true\n});\n```\n\n## Allowing Connections\n\nIn AWS, all network traffic in and out of **Elastic Network Interfaces** (ENIs)\nis controlled by **Security Groups**. You can think of Security Groups as a\nfirewall with a set of rules. By default, Security Groups allow no incoming\n(ingress) traffic and all outgoing (egress) traffic. You can add ingress rules\nto them to allow incoming traffic streams. To exert fine-grained control over\negress traffic, set `allowAllOutbound: false` on the `SecurityGroup`, after\nwhich you can add egress traffic rules.\n\nYou can manipulate Security Groups directly:\n\n```ts fixture=with-vpc\nconst mySecurityGroup = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'SecurityGroup', {\n  vpc,\n  description: 'Allow ssh access to ec2 instances',\n  allowAllOutbound: true   // Can be set to false\n});\nmySecurityGroup.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.anyIpv4(), ec2.Port.tcp(22), 'allow ssh access from the world');\n```\n\nAll constructs that create ENIs on your behalf (typically constructs that create\nEC2 instances or other VPC-connected resources) will all have security groups\nautomatically assigned. Those constructs have an attribute called\n**connections**, which is an object that makes it convenient to update the\nsecurity groups. If you want to allow connections between two constructs that\nhave security groups, you have to add an **Egress** rule to one Security Group,\nand an **Ingress** rule to the other. The connections object will automatically\ntake care of this for you:\n\n```ts fixture=conns\n// Allow connections from anywhere\nloadBalancer.connections.allowFromAnyIpv4(ec2.Port.tcp(443), 'Allow inbound HTTPS');\n\n// The same, but an explicit IP address\nloadBalancer.connections.allowFrom(ec2.Peer.ipv4('1.2.3.4/32'), ec2.Port.tcp(443), 'Allow inbound HTTPS');\n\n// Allow connection between AutoScalingGroups\nappFleet.connections.allowTo(dbFleet, ec2.Port.tcp(443), 'App can call database');\n```\n\n### Connection Peers\n\nThere are various classes that implement the connection peer part:\n\n```ts fixture=conns\n// Simple connection peers\nlet peer = ec2.Peer.ipv4(\"10.0.0.0/16\");\npeer = ec2.Peer.anyIpv4();\npeer = ec2.Peer.ipv6(\"::0/0\");\npeer = ec2.Peer.anyIpv6();\npeer = ec2.Peer.prefixList(\"pl-12345\");\nappFleet.connections.allowTo(peer, ec2.Port.tcp(443), 'Allow outbound HTTPS');\n```\n\nAny object that has a security group can itself be used as a connection peer:\n\n```ts fixture=conns\n// These automatically create appropriate ingress and egress rules in both security groups\nfleet1.connections.allowTo(fleet2, ec2.Port.tcp(80), 'Allow between fleets');\n\nappFleet.connections.allowFromAnyIpv4(ec2.Port.tcp(80), 'Allow from load balancer');\n```\n\n### Port Ranges\n\nThe connections that are allowed are specified by port ranges. A number of classes provide\nthe connection specifier:\n\n```ts\nec2.Port.tcp(80)\nec2.Port.tcpRange(60000, 65535)\nec2.Port.allTcp()\nec2.Port.allTraffic()\n```\n\n> NOTE: This set is not complete yet; for example, there is no library support for ICMP at the moment.\n> However, you can write your own classes to implement those.\n\n### Default Ports\n\nSome Constructs have default ports associated with them. For example, the\nlistener of a load balancer does (it's the public port), or instances of an\nRDS database (it's the port the database is accepting connections on).\n\nIf the object you're calling the peering method on has a default port associated with it, you can call\n`allowDefaultPortFrom()` and omit the port specifier. If the argument has an associated default port, call\n`allowDefaultPortTo()`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts fixture=conns\n// Port implicit in listener\nlistener.connections.allowDefaultPortFromAnyIpv4('Allow public');\n\n// Port implicit in peer\nappFleet.connections.allowDefaultPortTo(rdsDatabase, 'Fleet can access database');\n```\n\n## Machine Images (AMIs)\n\nAMIs control the OS that gets launched when you start your EC2 instance. The EC2\nlibrary contains constructs to select the AMI you want to use.\n\nDepending on the type of AMI, you select it a different way. Here are some\nexamples of things you might want to use:\n\n```ts lit=test/example.images.lit.ts\n// Pick the right Amazon Linux edition. All arguments shown are optional\n// and will default to these values when omitted.\nconst amznLinux = new ec2.AmazonLinuxImage({\n  generation: ec2.AmazonLinuxGeneration.AMAZON_LINUX,\n  edition: ec2.AmazonLinuxEdition.STANDARD,\n  virtualization: ec2.AmazonLinuxVirt.HVM,\n  storage: ec2.AmazonLinuxStorage.GENERAL_PURPOSE,\n});\n\n// Pick a Windows edition to use\nconst windows = new ec2.WindowsImage(ec2.WindowsVersion.WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_ENGLISH_FULL_BASE);\n\n// Look up the most recent image matching a set of AMI filters.\n// In this case, look up the NAT instance AMI, by using a wildcard\n// in the 'name' field:\nconst natAmi = new ec2.LookupMachineImage({\n  name: 'amzn-ami-vpc-nat-*',\n  owners: ['amazon'],\n});\n\n// For other custom (Linux) images, instantiate a `GenericLinuxImage` with\n// a map giving the AMI to in for each region:\n\nconst linux = new ec2.GenericLinuxImage({\n    'us-east-1': 'ami-97785bed',\n    'eu-west-1': 'ami-12345678',\n    // ...\n});\n\n// For other custom (Windows) images, instantiate a `GenericWindowsImage` with\n// a map giving the AMI to in for each region:\n\nconst genericWindows = new ec2.GenericWindowsImage({\n  'us-east-1': 'ami-97785bed',\n  'eu-west-1': 'ami-12345678',\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n> NOTE: The AMIs selected by `AmazonLinuxImage` or `LookupImage` will be cached in\n> `cdk.context.json`, so that your AutoScalingGroup instances aren't replaced while\n> you are making unrelated changes to your CDK app.\n>\n> To query for the latest AMI again, remove the relevant cache entry from\n> `cdk.context.json`, or use the `cdk context` command. For more information, see\n> [Runtime Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/context.html) in the CDK\n> developer guide.\n\n## VPN connections to a VPC\n\nCreate your VPC with VPN connections by specifying the `vpnConnections` props (keys are construct `id`s):\n\n```ts\nconst vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {\n  vpnConnections: {\n    dynamic: { // Dynamic routing (BGP)\n      ip: '1.2.3.4'\n    },\n    static: { // Static routing\n      ip: '4.5.6.7',\n      staticRoutes: [\n        '192.168.10.0/24',\n        '192.168.20.0/24'\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo create a VPC that can accept VPN connections, set `vpnGateway` to `true`:\n\n```ts\nconst vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {\n  vpnGateway: true\n});\n```\n\nVPN connections can then be added:\n```ts fixture=with-vpc\nvpc.addVpnConnection('Dynamic', {\n  ip: '1.2.3.4'\n});\n```\n\nRoutes will be propagated on the route tables associated with the private subnets.\n\nVPN connections expose [metrics (cloudwatch.Metric)](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-cloudwatch/README.md) across all tunnels in the account/region and per connection:\n\n```ts fixture=with-vpc\n// Across all tunnels in the account/region\nconst allDataOut = ec2.VpnConnection.metricAllTunnelDataOut();\n\n// For a specific vpn connection\nconst vpnConnection = vpc.addVpnConnection('Dynamic', {\n  ip: '1.2.3.4'\n});\nconst state = vpnConnection.metricTunnelState();\n```\n\n## VPC endpoints\nA VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.\n\nEndpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.\n\n```ts lit=test/integ.vpc-endpoint.lit.ts\n    // Add gateway endpoints when creating the VPC\n    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {\n      gatewayEndpoints: {\n        S3: {\n          service: ec2.GatewayVpcEndpointAwsService.S3\n        }\n      }\n    });\n\n    // Alternatively gateway endpoints can be added on the VPC\n    const dynamoDbEndpoint = vpc.addGatewayEndpoint('DynamoDbEndpoint', {\n      service: ec2.GatewayVpcEndpointAwsService.DYNAMODB\n    });\n\n    // This allows to customize the endpoint policy\n    dynamoDbEndpoint.addToPolicy(\n      new iam.PolicyStatement({ // Restrict to listing and describing tables\n        principals: [new iam.AnyPrincipal()],\n        actions: ['dynamodb:DescribeTable', 'dynamodb:ListTables'],\n        resources: ['*'],\n    }));\n\n    // Add an interface endpoint\n    vpc.addInterfaceEndpoint('EcrDockerEndpoint', {\n      service: ec2.InterfaceVpcEndpointAwsService.ECR_DOCKER,\n\n      // Uncomment the following to allow more fine-grained control over\n      // who can access the endpoint via the '.connections' object.\n      // open: false\n    });\n```\n\n### Security groups for interface VPC endpoints\nBy default, interface VPC endpoints create a new security group and traffic is **not**\nautomatically allowed from the VPC CIDR.\n\nUse the `connections` object to allow traffic to flow to the endpoint:\n\n```ts fixture=conns\nmyEndpoint.connections.allowDefaultPortFromAnyIpv4();\n```\n\nAlternatively, existing security groups can be used by specifying the `securityGroups` prop.\n\n## VPC endpoint services\nA VPC endpoint service enables you to expose a Network Load Balancer(s) as a provider service to consumers, who connect to your service over a VPC endpoint. You can restrict access to your service via whitelisted principals (anything that extends ArnPrincipal), and require that new connections be manually accepted.\n```ts\nnew VpcEndpointService(this, \"EndpointService\", {\n  vpcEndpointServiceLoadBalancers: [networkLoadBalancer1, networkLoadBalancer2],\n  acceptanceRequired: true,\n  whitelistedPrincipals: [new ArnPrincipal(\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root\")]\n});\n```\n\n## Bastion Hosts\nA bastion host functions as an instance used to access servers and resources in a VPC without open up the complete VPC on a network level.\nYou can use bastion hosts using a standard SSH connection targetting port 22 on the host. As an alternative, you can connect the SSH connection\nfeature of AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, which does not need an opened security group. (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/07/session-manager-launches-tunneling-support-for-ssh-and-scp/)\n\nA default bastion host for use via SSM can be configured like:\n```ts fixture=with-vpc\nconst host = new ec2.BastionHostLinux(this, 'BastionHost', { vpc });\n```\n\nIf you want to connect from the internet using SSH, you need to place the host into a public subnet. You can then configure allowed source hosts.\n```ts fixture=with-vpc\nconst host = new ec2.BastionHostLinux(this, 'BastionHost', {\n  vpc,\n  subnetSelection: { subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC },\n});\nhost.allowSshAccessFrom(ec2.Peer.ipv4('1.2.3.4/32'));\n```\n\nAs there are no SSH public keys deployed on this machine, you need to use [EC2 Instance Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/compute/new-using-amazon-ec2-instance-connect-for-ssh-access-to-your-ec2-instances/)\nwith the command `aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key` to provide your SSH public key.\n\n\n## Block Devices\n\nTo add EBS block device mappings, specify the `blockDeviceMappings` property. The follow example sets the EBS-backed\nroot device (`/dev/sda1`) size to 50 GiB, and adds another EBS-backed device mapped to `/dev/sdm` that is 100 GiB in\nsize:\n\n```ts\nnew ec2.Instance(this, 'Instance', {\n  // ...\n  blockDeviceMappings: [\n    {\n      deviceName: '/dev/sda1',\n      volume: ec2.BlockDeviceVolume.ebs(50),\n    },\n    {\n      deviceName: '/dev/sdm',\n      volume: ec2.BlockDeviceVolume.ebs(100),\n    },\n  ],\n});\n\n```\n"

Like IAM Roles, Security\nGroups need to exist to control access between AWS resources, but CDK will\nautomatically generate and populate them with least-privilege permissions\nfor you so you can concentrate on your business logic.\n\nAll Constructs that require Security Groups will create one for you if you\ndon't specify one at construction. After construction, you can selectively\nallow connections to and between constructs via--for example-- the `instance.connections`\nobject. Think of it as \"allowing connections to your instance\", rather than\n\"adding ingress rules a security group\". See the [Allowing\nConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html#allowing-connections)\nsection in the library documentation for examples.\n\nDirect manipulation of the Security Group through `addIngressRule` and\n`addEgressRule` is possible, but mutation through the `.connections` object\nis recommended. If you peer two constructs with security groups this way,\nappropriate rules will be created in both.\n\nIf you have an existing security group you want to use in your CDK application,\nyou would import it like this:\n\n```ts\nconst securityGroup = SecurityGroup.fromSecurityGroupId(this, 'SG', 'sg-12345', {\n   mutable: false\n});\n```",
