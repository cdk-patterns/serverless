/**
 * A Deployment of a REST API.
 *
 * An immutable representation of a RestApi resource that can be called by users
 * using Stages. A deployment must be associated with a Stage for it to be
 * callable over the Internet.
 *
 * Normally, you don't need to define deployments manually. The RestApi
 * construct manages a Deployment resource that represents the latest model. It
 * can be accessed through `restApi.latestDeployment` (unless `deploy: false` is
 * set when defining the `RestApi`).
 *
 * If you manually define this resource, you will need to know that since
 * deployments are immutable, as long as the resource's logical ID doesn't
 * change, the deployment will represent the snapshot in time in which the
 * resource was created. This means that if you modify the RestApi model (i.e.
 * add methods or resources), these changes will not be reflected unless a new
 * deployment resource is created.
 *
 * To achieve this behavior, the method `addToLogicalId(data)` can be used to
 * augment the logical ID generated for the deployment resource such that it
 * will include arbitrary data. This is done automatically for the
 * `restApi.latestDeployment` deployment.
 *
 * Furthermore, since a deployment does not reference any of the REST API
 * resources and methods, CloudFormation will likely provision it before these
 * resources are created, which means that it will represent a "half-baked"
 * model. Use the `node.addDependency(dep)` method to circumvent that. This is done
 * automatically for the `restApi.latestDeployment` deployment.
