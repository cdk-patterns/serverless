# How To Contribute
This repo is designed to be a collection of aws serverless architecture patterns built with cdk. That means it should
eventually hold a cdk version of all patterns presented by AWS heros. If you want to contribute follow these steps:

1. Find a pattern that you want to share
2. Open an issue on this repo stating that you want to add this pattern so other people don't duplicate effort. Include links to arch pics in the issue
3. Branch the repo into your own personal github account
4. Build your pattern, make sure you add unit tests and a useful level of documentation including a simple arch diagram. Please make sure you credit the original creator of the pattern, this is not about stealing content.
5. Make sure your pattern has the npm run deploy task added
6. Open up a pull request and start the merge discussion!
